1. It Must be unique
        Whatever locator you choose to use must be unique enough

2. Should not contain any numbers => there is a possibility that the number might be dynamic and it might change

Why do we have multiple locators?

    a locator might not be present
    to avoid duplication in the locators and being more specific

get() vs navigate()
-- navigate can move back, forward and refresh
-- get() will wait for the page to fully load whereas navigate() will not
-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

close() vs quit()
-- close() will close the current tab
-- quit() will quit the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser, and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application


What is a WebElement?
    anything we see on the web page is considered to be a WebElement
    e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
    HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
    internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
    Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
    Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
    Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
    is an address or a position of an webElement on the web page
    is used to locate or identify webElements on the webpage

8 Locators:
    - ID
    - Name
    - Tagname
    - xpath
    - linktext
    - partialLinkText
    - CSS Selector
    - ClassName


Why do we need many locators?
    -- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
    -- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
    -- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
        e.g., linkText and partialLinkText is only used for Links

there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator...

if an attribute value has a number in it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.!!!!!
