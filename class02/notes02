Linktext, partialLintext (they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some Text)


"a" tag is also called an anchor tag, its for the link ...
it must have a link and the text .. the text is going to be there almost everytime


if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, Selenium will only interact with the
first element it locates, we try to find elements as uniquely as possible


there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator...

if a attribute value has a number in it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.!!!!!



difference in linkText and partial link Text?

a partial link text you can use just a part of text, just make sure that it is unqiue enough to stand out .

1.Relative Xpath:

	a.Syntax for xpath (finding by attribute):
							//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']

							translation:
									hey get me the tagname , which has an 'attribute' whose value is "attribute value"


                              *****   Example  ****

								<input name ="abra" ,class ="fhdhfd"/>


								task is to write down the xpath to get to this webElement:

								//input[@name='abra']

								translate:

								hey get me the tag "input" which has an attribute name whose value is "abra";






	b.Syntax for xpath (finding by text):
									//tagname[text()='text value']


									translation :
										hey get me the tagname which has a text    "text value".

									condition :
										our html code (webelement) must have text.
										****Example:****

									<button id="tro", class="fyo"> heelo </button>
									answer:
										//button[text()='heelo']



	c.Syntax for xpath (finding by contains method):

							for tagname

								//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

								translation :

								get me the tag name which has an attribute whose value contains
								 "partial value of the attribute"


                                      ******Example**********
                              <input email= "how are you i am fine , thank you" id="dsfs"/>

                               xpath using contains method:

                                            //input[contains(@email,'how are you')]



                               for text

                                        //tagname[contains(text(), 'partial text value')]





contains can be used in a scenario where
1.the attribute or text is very long
2.when part of the value or text is dynamic
