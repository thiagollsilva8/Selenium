Xpath:

    1. Absolute xpath --> starts with / and the root node (it is not widely used because the tree might change)
    2. Relative Xpath
        a. Attribute
            a.1. //tagname[@attribute='value']

            Contains methods in attribute
            a.2. //tagname[contains@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

            Starts with method in attribute
            a.3. //tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

        b. Text

            b.1. //tagname[text()="value"]

            Contains methods in attribute
            b.2. //tagname[contains(text(), 'partial attribute value')]

            Starts with method in text
            b.3. //tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

Notes:

    1. If you are unable to write diwn the unique xpath(no matter if you tried to use various available xpath)
    Then you can use
        Indexing to select your desire one

        * (//tagname[@attribute='value'])[index Number] ---> Index number starts with 1

    2. Use the contains or starts with only when
        1) The text or attribute is containing a dynamic part and you are left with no other option
        2) The text or attribute is long enough (and you are sure that it will always remain unique)

CSS Selector

    Syntax:
        tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']

    Limitation: You cannot use text with CSS Selector

Shortcuts are there un CSS selector that can be used to locate an element
    a. Shortcut for className --> "."
        tagName[class = 'attribute value'] ---> tagName.attribute Value

    b. Shortcut for ID --> "#"
        tagName[id = 'attribute value'] ---> tagName#attribute Value

    c. We have a contains method in CSS as well
        * represents contains
        tagName[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']

    d. We have a starts with method in CSS as well
        ^ sign represents the starts with
        tagName[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']

    e. We have a ends with method also in CSS
        $ symbol represents ends-with method in CSS
        tagName[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']

Focus should be on:

    Writing the locator that gets us the unique value, also we should make sure at our end that the future changes
    will most probably not affect our xpath (try your best in this)
