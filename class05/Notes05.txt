Alerts:
Alert is a pop-up message. Alert takes complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:
1. web based alerts/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. JavaScript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with selenium

Types of JavaScript alerts:
1. Simple Alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter text and then click ok

To handle JS alerts, we only have 4 methods
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()


Frames:
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch manually to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch manually to a frame and switch manually back to the main page

Handling multiple windows:
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
It is approximately 40 alphanumeric character ID
